# Prompt Elements

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Element</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Impact</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Clear &amp; Specific Task/Instruction</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        The core action you want the AI to perform. This should be an
        unambiguous and direct command or question. Use action verbs and avoid
        vagueness
      </td>
      <td>
        This is the fundamental directive for the AI. Without a clear task, the
        model has no direction and is likely to produce irrelevant or generic
        output
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Context</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        The background information, setting, or circumstances relevant to the
        task. This helps the AI understand the "why" behind your request
      </td>
      <td>
        Context narrows the AI's focus, allowing it to generate a more relevant
        and tailored response that aligns with your specific situation or need
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Expectations</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        Clearly defining what a "good" response looks like including
        completeness, level of detail, or aspects to emphasize or avoid
      </td>
      <td>
        Helps the AI align more closely with success criteria, reducing
        trial-and-error by anticipating how the output will be evaluated or used
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Role/Persona</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        Assigning a specific role or persona for the AI to adopt (e.g., "Act as
        a seasoned financial analyst," "You are a creative copywriter")
      </td>
      <td>
        This significantly influences the tone, style, vocabulary, and even the
        reasoning process of the AI, leading to more authentic and useful
        outputs
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Audience</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        Specifying the intended audience for the AI's response (e.g., "Explain
        this to a 5-year-old," "Write for a technical audience")
      </td>
      <td>
        This dictates the level of complexity, language, and detail in the
        response, ensuring it is understandable and impactful for the target
        reader
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Format</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        Defining the desired structure of the output (e.g., "in a bulleted
        list," "as a JSON object," "in a table with columns for...")
      </td>
      <td>
        A specified format ensures the information is organized in a usable and
        easily digestible manner, saving time on post-processing
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Source</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        Providing authoritative references or datasets the AI should base its
        response on, or citing where information should come from
      </td>
      <td>
        Anchors the AI's response in credibility or required material,
        especially critical for factual accuracy, traceability, or domain
        compliance
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        Providing one or more examples of the desired input-output pattern
      </td>
      <td>
        This is a powerful way to guide the AI's response, especially for
        complex or novel tasks, by demonstrating the expected style and
        structure
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Constraints &amp; Negative Constraints</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        Setting boundaries or limitations on the response (e.g., "in under 200
        words," "do not include technical jargon," "avoid using passive voice")
      </td>
      <td>
        Constraints help to refine the output, making it more focused and
        aligned with specific requirements. Negative constraints are
        particularly useful for avoiding undesirable content
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Tone &amp; Style</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        Describing the desired emotional or stylistic quality of the response
        (e.g., "formal," "humorous," "empathetic," "optimistic")
      </td>
      <td>
        Tone and style add a layer of personality and nuance to the output,
        making it more engaging and appropriate for the context
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Chain of Thought/Step-by-Step Reasoning</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        Instructing the AI to "think step-by-step" or outline its reasoning
        process before providing the final answer
      </td>
      <td>
        This technique can improve the accuracy of the final output, especially
        for complex reasoning tasks, and provides transparency into the AI's
        process
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Questioning &amp; Iteration</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        Asking clarifying questions within the prompt or planning for iterative
        refinement of the AI's responses
      </td>
      <td>
        This fosters a more collaborative interaction, allowing you to guide the
        AI towards a better answer through a series of prompts
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Request for Multiple Versions</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        Asking for several different versions or perspectives on the same topic
      </td>
      <td>
        This can be useful for brainstorming, exploring different creative
        angles, or A/B testing different approaches
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Inclusion of Keywords</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        Strategically placing important keywords within the prompt that you want
        to see in the output
      </td>
      <td>
        This can help to ensure that the AI's response focuses on the most
        critical aspects of your request
      </td>
    </tr>
