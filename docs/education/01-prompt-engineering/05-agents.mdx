    AI Agent - is a software program that uses artificial intelligence to autonomously interact with its environment and achieve specific goals set by a user or another system. These agents can process information, learn from experience, and make decisions to perform tasks on behalf of a user.

        subgraph Tools
            api(API call)
            web(Access Internet)
            code(Interprete Code)
        end

        user(User) ---> autonomousAction(Autonomous Action)

        agent ---> reactivity(Reactivity)
        reactivity --> env(Environment)
        agent ---> delegateTasks(Delegate Tasks)
        agent ---> Tools
    ```

    **Key Characteristics**

    - **Autonomy**: operates independently for efficient task performance in unpredictable environments
    - **Reactivity**: perceives environmental changes and responds in real-time to handle dynamic situations
    - **Proactivity**: exhibits goal-directed behavior with initiative, planning, and strategic execution
    - **Social Ability**: designed for collaboration and communication with agents or humans, essential for multi-agent systems
    - **Learning Capabilities**: improves performance by learning from experiences and adjusting strategies for continuous adaptation
    - **Goal-Orientation**: driven by specific objectives, ensuring purposeful actions contribute to predefined outcomes
    - **Rationality**: makes decisions to maximize performance by processing information and selecting optimal approaches
